## Project Purpose

This project was created out of the need to design a modern, reliable, and future-proof Neovim configuration from scratch, fully aligned with the latest stable versions of Neovim and its ecosystem.

Over time, many community configurations became incompatible or unstable due to major changes in core components such as Neovim itself, Lazy.nvim, nvim-treesitter, and the built-in LSP client. Common issues encountered in outdated setups include runtime errors like treesitter.configs not found, deprecated APIs, broken plugin loading, incorrect Treesitter initialization, and inconsistent LSP behavior.

This repository aims to eliminate these issues by rebuilding the configuration using the current recommended patterns, APIs, and plugin specifications. Special care was taken to ensure correct initialization order, proper plugin lazy-loading, and full compatibility with recent changes in:

- Neovim core APIs
- Lazy.nvim plugin specifications
- nvim-treesitter module loading
- LSP configuration and attachment lifecycle
- Mason.nvim tooling management
- Formatting and linting workflows
- Autocompletion and snippet integration
- The project integrates modern development tools such as Treesitter, Language Servers, formatters, linters, autocompletion engines, snippets, terminal multiplexing (tmux), fuzzy finding, and optional AI-assisted workflows, all following the current best practices of the Neovim ecosystem.
- This configuration is intended for intermediate users who want a clean, extensible, and well-structured Neovim setup that can serve both as a daily driver and as a learning reference for modern Neovim architecture.
- Finally, it is important to note that this is an actively developed project. The configuration is continuously refined to adapt to upstream changes, fix newly discovered issues, and incorporate improvements as Neovim and its plugins evolve.

---

## Target Audience

This project is primarily intended for:

- **Intermediate Neovim users** who already have practical experience with custom configurations
- Developers familiar with **plugins, LSP integration, and modern Neovim workflows**
- Users who want to **understand, customize, and maintain** their Neovim setup using Lua

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is not recommended for absolute beginners, as it assumes prior knowledge of Neovim concepts and configuration practices.

## Installation

This project requires several system-level dependencies and a manual setup process.

For a complete, step-by-step installation guide — including all required dependencies, system tools, Neovim and TMUX configuration, and optional components — please refer to the dedicated installation document:

👉 **[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)**

The installation guide is designed to be **copied and pasted directly** into the terminal and was primarily tested on **Linux (Pop!\_OS 24.04 – COSMIC)**.

> ⚠️ Other Linux distributions, macOS, or WSL may require minor adjustments.

## How to Use

After installation, you must configure the programming languages you want to use.  
**nvim-tmux** relies on **Treesitter**, **Mason**, and **LSP** to provide syntax highlighting, autocomplete, diagnostics, formatting, and linting.

Adding a new language is done in **three main steps**.

### 1️⃣ Add the language to Treesitter (better colors & syntax)

To get better colors, indentation, and code structure, add the language to:

in nvim-tmux/lua/plugins/treesitter.lua

Inside the `ensure_installed` list, add the desired language:

```lua
require("nvim-treesitter").install({
  "lua",
  "python",
  "javascript",
  "typescript",
  -- add your new language here
})
```

Treesitter is responsible for: Advanced syntax highlighting, smart indentation, incremental selection, better code readability.

### 2️⃣ Install linters, formatters, and tools (Mason Tool Installer)

To automatically download linters, formatters, and other tools, edit:

nvim-tmux/lua/plugins/lsp/mason-tool-installer-nvim.lua

Add the required tools to the ensure_installed list:

```lua
ensure_installed = {
  -- Formatters
  "prettier",
  "stylua",
  -- add formatters for the new language here

  -- Linters
  "eslint_d",
  "luacheck",
  -- add linters for the new language here
}
```

This step enables: Automatic code formatting, static code analysis, integration with conform.nvim and nvim-lint.

### 3️⃣ Add the Language Server (LSP)

To enable autocomplete, diagnostics, go-to-definition, and hover documentation, edit:

nvim-tmux/lua/plugins/lsp/mason.lua

Add the language server to the ensure_installed list:

```lua
ensure_installed = {
  "lua_ls",
  "pyright",
  "ts_ls",
  -- add the LSP server for the new language here
}
```

The LSP provides:Intelligent autocomplete, real-time errors and warnings, code navigation (definitions, references), inline documentation.

### 4️⃣ Formatting and Linting Setup

To configure and identify formatters per language, edit the following file:
nvim-tmux/lua/plugins/lsp/conform-nvim.lua

```lua
formatters_by_ft = {
    lua = { "stylua" },
	javascript = { "prettier" },
	typescript = { "prettier" },
    -- add here
}
```

To configure and identify linters per language, edit the following file:
nvim-tmux/lua/plugins/lsp/nvim-lint.lua

```lua
lint.linters_by_ft = {
	javascript = { "eslint_d" },
	typescript = { "eslint_d" },
	javascriptreact = { "eslint_d" },
    -- add here
}
```

🔁 Apply changes

After configuring a language:

Save all files

Restart Neovim

Let Mason automatically install the required dependencies
